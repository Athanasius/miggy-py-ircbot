TODO:

	Get all URL Parsing via SpiffyTitles looking the same as
	perl-Cmdr
		YouTube						DONE
		Imgur						DONE
		community.elitedangerous.com (galnet)		DONE
		Coriolis.edcd.io, coriolis.io & eddp.co		Ignored
		Reddit						DONE

	RSS feeds - need the forum de-dupe code, so likely need to make
	a new plugin based on the existing one.
		Both now working with sensible polling periods.
		 and with custom messages.

	Review commands on perl-Cmdr and ensure py-Cmdr is as close as
	possible, including being as quiet as possible in the channel.

	Q-Auth, preferably before joining channels.
